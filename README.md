# hellfuncs

**hellfig**: Makes a nice figure which is already formatted with my (Helena) preferences. Can specify things such as number of subplots, aspect ratio, x and y limits, etc. 

**hellgif**: add this function into a loop that is animating a plot and it will create and save a gif.

**hellgrid**: input a set of data and it will grid it into requested bins based on x and y location. Will return statistics such as mean, std, and bootstrap mean.

**hellcheckin**: _in progress_. asks user to report how stressed and confident they feel. Saves data and plots trends.
