# hellfuncs

**hellfig**: Makes a nice figure which is already formatted with my (Helena) preferences. Can specify things such as number of subplots, aspect ratio, x and y limits, etc. 

**hellgif**: add this function into a loop that is animating a plot and it will create and save a gif.

**hellgrid**: input a set of data and it will grid it into requested bins based on x and y location. Will return statistics such as mean, std, and bootstrap mean.

**hellclose**: closes all of the files not in your current directory

**helldir**: changes directory to the folders I (helena) use a lot. This wont be helpful for you unless you copy and paste it to your own function

**helltexfile**: makes a tex file that works for my homework specifically
